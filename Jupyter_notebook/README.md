# Jupyter Notebook

This folder contains the full project notebook in multiple formats for convenience and sharing.

## Files

- **ML_Student_Performance_Project.ipynb**  
  The original interactive Jupyter Notebook used for analysis, modeling, and experimentation.

- **ML_Student_Performance_Project.pdf**  
  A static PDF export of the notebook, ideal for quick review or sharing with people who don’t use Jupyter.

- **ML_Student_Performance_Project.html**  
  A standalone HTML version of the notebook, viewable in any browser without dependencies.

## Notes
- All three files contain the **same project content**, only in different export formats.
- The `.ipynb` file is the executable version; the PDF and HTML are read-only exports.
